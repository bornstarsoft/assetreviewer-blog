In a groundbreaking shift for the gaming industry, Netflix is set to redefine the FIFA gaming experience with a new title aimed at the upcoming 2026 World Cup. With Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer at Konami and mastermind behind the Fox Engine, at the helm, the project promises to bring a fresh perspective to football games, moving away from the traditional EA Sports model that fans have known for years.

Merceron's extensive background in developing football games, particularly through his work on the Fox Engine for titles like Metal Gear Solid 5 and Pro Evolution Soccer, positions him uniquely to lead this ambitious reimagining. Delphi Interactive, the studio behind the new FIFA game, is committed to creating a title that resonates with both long-time fans and newcomers alike, emphasizing fun and accessibility without sacrificing depth.

As we look forward to this innovative approach to FIFA, one can't help but wonder: will Netflix's foray into gaming set a new standard for how sports titles are developed and delivered? The future of FIFA gaming is not just about a new game; it's about a new way to experience football.
