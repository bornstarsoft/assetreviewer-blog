Hamster Corporation has just announced an exciting wave of classic console games coming to modern platforms, including the highly anticipated Console Archives series. This initiative aims to bring beloved 8 and 32-bit titles back into the spotlight, allowing both nostalgic players and newcomers to experience these gems on the PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2.

The first two titles available now are Cool Boarders and Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos, with more classics set to follow. The complete line-up includes fan favorites like Doraemon, Nobunagas Ambition, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure, all featuring modern enhancements such as customizable controls and CRT filters to recreate that vintage gaming feel. 

As we look forward to the release of these classics, it raises an interesting question: which title are you most excited to revisit or discover for the first time?
