In the upcoming game Resident Evil Requiem, players will experience a unique blend of gameplay through its dual protagonists, Leon and Grace. This innovative approach not only splits their gameplay almost equally but also contrasts Leon's adrenaline-pumping action with Grace's horror-centric segments, creating a dynamic rhythm that promises to keep players on their toes. As director Akifumi Nakanishi notes, this combination aims to offer a fresh take on the Resident Evil formula, providing both thrill and terror in a single narrative.

Leon, portrayed as a seasoned veteran, brings martial arts and melee combat reminiscent of Resident Evil 4, while Grace embodies the essence of fear, reminiscent of Resident Evil 2. This duality not only enhances the storytelling but also enriches the gameplay experience, allowing players to switch between intense action and suspenseful horror seamlessly. The game is set to release on February 27, 2026, across multiple platforms, including PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2, and it raises the question: how will this innovative structure redefine the survival horror genre?
