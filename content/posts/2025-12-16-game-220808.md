Bungie has officially announced the release date and pricing for its highly anticipated extraction shooter, Marathon, set to launch in March 2026. Priced at $39.99/39.99/34.99, this game promises to deliver a rich experience without the burden of pay-to-win mechanics, ensuring all players have equal access to gameplay updates and rewards.

Originally scheduled for a September 2023 release, Marathon faced delays due to community feedback and concerns over artwork controversies. The development team has taken this time to refine the game, introducing features like proximity chat and a new solo experience, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

As we look forward to the launch, its clear that Bungie is committed to creating a game that resonates with its community. Will Marathon set a new standard for extraction shooters in the gaming landscape? Only time will tell.
