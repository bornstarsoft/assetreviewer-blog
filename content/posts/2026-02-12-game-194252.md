In a heartfelt revelation, Fable creator Peter Molyneux expressed his emotional reaction to the recent gameplay reveal of the rebooted Fable by Playground Games. During an interview with IGN, Molyneux shared that he teared up while watching the trailer, reflecting on the legacy of the game he helped create. He emphasized the significance of seeing the beloved world of Fable continue to thrive, stating, "This thing that we created, its going to live, its going to carry on."

Molyneux praised Playground Games for their decision to retell the Fable story rather than continuing from the original games, which he believes could have been a heavy burden. He appreciated the clever references in the trailer, like the transformation of a child's family into stone. However, he did voice some concerns about the aesthetic, describing it as having a slight "antiseptic feel" and longing for the chaotic character that defined the original Fable experience.

Despite these minor criticisms, Molyneux is excited about the new Fable and looks forward to immersing himself in its universe once again. As fans await the release, one can't help but wonder: will this new iteration capture the essence of what made the original Fable so enchanting?
