In a surprising revelation, Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke disclosed that neither PlayStation nor Xbox were aware of the upcoming Divinity game until its announcement at The Game Awards. This level of secrecy underscores the studio's commitment to keeping their projects under wraps, even from major platform holders. Vincke's comments highlight the excitement and anticipation surrounding the new title, which aims to build on the success of Baldur's Gate 3.

The announcement came with a tantalizing description: "The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir." This suggests a rich narrative and expansive gameplay that fans of the RPG genre can look forward to. While the leak of trademark information hinted at the new game prior to the awards, the official reveal still managed to catch many off guard, including the console manufacturers themselves.

As Larian Studios prepares to engage with PlayStation and Xbox about the new Divinity title, the gaming community is left wondering what innovative features and storytelling elements will be introduced. Will this new installment redefine RPGs once again? Only time will tell.
