In a surprising turn of events, Walmart may have inadvertently revealed two unannounced GameCube classics set to join the Nintendo Switch Online library. Social media users have spotted an image on Walmart's website showcasing a selection of games, including the beloved Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2, which have yet to be officially announced by Nintendo.

This leak raises questions about the future of the Nintendo Switch Online service, particularly its GameCube library, which is currently limited to Switch 2 users. While Nintendo has confirmed a few titles like Super Mario Sunshine and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, the addition of Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 would certainly excite fans eager for more classic content. With the original Metroid Prime receiving a remaster, it seems the stars are aligning for a nostalgic revival.

As we await official confirmation from Nintendo, this leak could hint at a broader strategy to expand the GameCube offerings on Switch Online. Are we on the brink of seeing more beloved titles from the GameCube era make their way to the modern gaming landscape? Only time will tell.
