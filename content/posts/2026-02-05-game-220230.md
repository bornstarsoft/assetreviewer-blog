Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa recently addressed concerns regarding the rising costs of memory components and their potential impact on the pricing of the upcoming Switch 2. Despite the surge in RAM prices, largely driven by increased demand from AI data centers, Furukawa reassured shareholders that there are currently no plans to adjust the console's price. This decision reflects Nintendo's commitment to maintaining a stable supply chain and ensuring long-term profitability.

Furukawa emphasized that any future price changes would be based on a comprehensive evaluation of various factors, including market conditions, sales trends, and overall profitability. He noted the importance of the second and third years of the Switch 2's lifecycle, suggesting that maintaining competitive pricing could lead to increased software sales, ultimately benefiting the company in the long run. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo navigates these challenges while keeping its loyal fanbase engaged.
