In an intriguing revelation, a player of Monster Hunter Wilds has discovered that the game runs significantly better on PC when all downloadable content (DLC) is installed. This finding, shared by Reddit user de_Tylmarande, suggests that the games performance issues may stem from an aggressive DLC ownership check that negatively impacts frame rates for players without the additional content.

After testing on different accounts, the player noted a stark contrast in performance: their friend's account with all DLC saw frame rates soar above 80 FPS, while their own account, lacking the DLC, struggled with drops down to 20-25 FPS. This led to the hypothesis that the game continuously checks for DLC presence, and when it detects all DLC installed, it stops these checks, resulting in smoother gameplay.

While de_Tylmarande created a mod to bypass the DLC checks purely for testing, they emphasized that this was not a recommendation for others to follow. Instead, they hope Capcom will address this issue, which could enhance the gaming experience for many players on Steam. As we look ahead, will Capcom respond to this performance dilemma and improve the experience for its community?
