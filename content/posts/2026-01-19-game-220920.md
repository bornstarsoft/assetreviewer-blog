Exciting news for gamers! The beloved Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is set to receive a significant update, bringing 60 FPS gameplay to both PS5 and PS5 Pro. This enhancement, announced by Ubisoft and shared through PlayStation's official channels, promises to deliver a smoother and more immersive experience for players revisiting this iconic title.

Originally launched in 2012, Far Cry 3 has captivated millions, selling over 10 million copies by late 2014. While Xbox Series S and X players have already enjoyed the 60 FPS upgrade, PS4 users have expressed disappointment over their exclusion from this update. For those looking to dive back into the action, the game is available as part of the Far Cry Anthology Bundle on the PlayStation Store, currently on sale for $37.49 until January 22.

As we gear up for this update, it raises the question: how will enhanced frame rates continue to shape our gaming experiences in the future?
