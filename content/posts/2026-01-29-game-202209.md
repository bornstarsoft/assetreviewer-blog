Indie game developers Team Afternoon are set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, for free on Steam. This unique title takes players on a nostalgic journey back to the Windows 98 era, blending strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation elements into a captivating gameplay experience. The game challenges players to create a perfect "fake clear video" from chaotic dungeon raids, turning a failed attempt into a heroic narrative.

At the heart of the game lies a sophisticated timeline editing mechanic, where players must arrange clips of various actions to craft an illusion of victory. The emphasis on precision is paramount, as the developers stress that every frame counts in creating these miraculous edits. This innovative approach not only engages players in strategic thinking but also offers a satirical commentary on the nature of heroism and perception in gaming.

As we anticipate the release of "Don't You Trust Me?", it raises intriguing questions about the nature of success and the narratives we construct around our failures. Will players embrace the challenge of crafting their own heroic tales, or will they find the process too daunting? Only time will tell!
