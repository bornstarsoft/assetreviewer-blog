November 2025 marked a significant downturn for the gaming industry, as hardware sales and physical game spending in the US reached their lowest levels in 30 years. According to Circana's latest report, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a stark contrast to the 1.4 million sold back in 1995. This decline is particularly concerning given that November is typically a peak month for sales due to Black Friday and holiday shopping.

The average price for new gaming hardware hit an all-time high of $439, which is 11% higher than last year. This price increase likely contributed to the overall drop in sales, as consumers may be hesitant to spend more on consoles. Notably, the PlayStation 5 led in sales, followed by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S, indicating that while demand exists, affordability remains a significant barrier.

In addition to hardware, physical software sales also saw a decline, with a 14% drop compared to last November. While digital sales are likely on the rise, the overall trend raises questions about the future of dedicated gaming devices. As Circana's Mat Piscatella noted, manufacturers may struggle to lower prices amidst rising component costs. Will this trend continue, or can we expect a resurgence in sales as the market adapts to these challenges?
