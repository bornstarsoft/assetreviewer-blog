The 2026 Taipei International Game Show was a vibrant showcase of gaming culture, and the "Dolls Frontline 2: Exilium" booth stood out with its captivating cosplayers and interactive experiences. Fans were treated to a delightful array of characters brought to life by talented cosplayers, creating an engaging atmosphere that celebrated both the game and its community.

Visitors had the chance to participate in a Memory Puzzle Game, where their commander level in the app could enhance their gameplay experience. The booth featured stunning representations of beloved characters like Macchiato and Mayuzumi Smoke, alongside eye-catching figures of Sentau Lacey and Kunkai in both swimsuit and battle attire. This blend of cute and cool aesthetics not only attracted fans but also fostered a sense of camaraderie among attendees.

As we reflect on the success of the Dolflo 2 booth, its clear that events like these not only promote games but also build a vibrant community around them. What other surprises might future gaming conventions hold for fans and creators alike?
